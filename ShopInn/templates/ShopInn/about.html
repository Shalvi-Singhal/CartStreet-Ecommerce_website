        <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">In a nutshell, e-commerce is just the process of buying and selling produce by electronic means such as by mobile applications and the Internet.
            Ecommerce refers to both online retail and online shopping as well as electronic transactions. Ecommerce has hugely increased in popularity over the last decades,
            and in ways, it's replacing traditional brick and mortar stores.
            Ecommerce enables you to buy and sell products on a global scale, twenty-four hours a day without incurring the same overheads as you would with running a brick and mortar store.
